Infrastructure dollars in the Senate package include: $870 million per year for the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program, which dedicates funding for rural communities facing budget shortfalls to address essential needs like schools and emergency services; /// The bipartisan infrastructure legislation passed by the Senate and will soon be considered by the House includes several provisions important to the agriculture community. Infrastructure dollars in the Senate package include: $65 billion to connect every American to high-quality, reliable broadband internet access Supported H.R. 3369, the Broadband for Rural America Act. This legislation will provide additional investments in USDA rural broadband programs while prioritizing rural areas most underserved. Supported S. 1695 and H.R. 3193, the Eliminating Barriers to Rural Internet Development Grant Eligibility (EBRIDGE) Act. This legislation removes hurdles for broadband projects, including difficult last-mile efforts that often delay rural broadband deployment. /// Concern of repealing the 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Rule (NWPR) and going back to a foundational rule is losing elements of the NWPR that benefit Agriculture. The NWPR very clearly protects lakes, rivers and streams. Most ditches and areas where water just collects after rain are excluded, which is appropriate, because they are not navigable waters. Farmers and ranchers are taking proactive, voluntary steps to conserve resources and protect our nations water. These conservation practices are keeping the nutrients applied to crops in the field and out of waterways. It is critical for agriculture to have a steady definition of waters of the United States that continues to bring clarity and certainty to clean water efforts. /// The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) temporarily doubled the estate tax exemption from $5.5 million to $11 million per person ($11.7 million indexed for 2021) through 2025. While the higher temporary exemption level protects the vast majority of the nations farms and ranches from the devastating consequences of estate taxes, farm and ranch families with businesses that top the exemption level are still plagued by estate taxes and related planning costs. Supported HR H.R. 2370, to allow more farm and ranch land to be valued at its agricultural value rather than its inflated development value for estate tax purposes. Farm and ranch families who want to continue farming and ranching when a family member dies should be able to pay estate taxes on the value of their current business, not what their land would be worth if they sold out to a developer. The Section 2032A valuation tool for estate tax purposes was designed to provide farm and ranch families protection from burdensome estate taxes when passing down the family business. The deduction carefully delineates between types of property eligible for the Special Use Valuation by targeting estate tax relief to farm and ranch operations where the family plans to continue farming and ranching. Though the Section 2032A reduction limit originally outlined in the law was updated to increase with inflation, it no longer provides the level of protection it was meant to offer farmers and ranchers. Expanding the provision would allow more farm and ranch land to qualify for Section 2032A Special Use Valuation, restoring it value as the helpful estate planning tool that was intended by Congress. Monitored the American Families Plan. Tthe American Families Plan, proposes tax cuts and programs including: Step Up in Basis Would be Repealed and Instead Capital Gains Taxes Would be Collected at Death Stepped up basis provides that capital gains taxes are not imposed when assets are transferred at death to an heir. Furthermore, tax law allows the heir to increase their basis in the assets to fair market value and only owe capital gains taxes on the amount the asset appreciates while they owed it and only if the asset is sold. The proposal would repeal step up in basis for gains over $1 million and collect capital gains at death unless assets are donated to charity. A proposed protection for family-owned farms and businesses is not explained. Capital Gains Tax Rates Will Almost Double for Some Farms and ranches pay capital gains taxes when they sell long-term capital assets like land and buildings. The tax is based on the amount that the asset has increased in value since purchase which can be significant for agriculture where assets are typically held for a long time. Capital gains tax rates would increase from 20% to 39.6% for households making over $1 million. Like Kind Exchange (1031) Are Repealed Like Kind Exchanges allow farmers and ranchers and other businesses to defer capital gains taxes when they sell an asset and replace it with a similar asset. Farmers and ranchers use like kind exchanges for capital assets like land and single-purpose structures. The proposal repeals like kind exchanges for exchanges for gains greater than $500,000. Individual Income Tax Rate Will Increase According to the Census of Agriculture, about 94% of farm and ranch businesses pay taxes using individual tax rates, as sole-proprietors or partnerships. The proposal increases the top individual income tax rate bracket from 37% to 39.6 %. /// Reviewed President Bidens U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021. The proposal seeks to allow undocumented individuals to apply for temporary legal status. DACA recipients, TPS holders, and immigrant farmworkers who meet specific requirements are eligible for green cards immediately under the legislation. After three years, all green card holders who pass additional background checks and demonstrate knowledge of English and U.S. civics can apply to become citizens. Applicants must be physically present in the United States on or before January 1, 2021. The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may waive the presence requirement for those deported on or after January 20, 2017 who were physically present for at least three years prior to removal for family unity and other humanitarian purposes. The bill requires that DHS and the Department of Labor establish a commission involving labor, employer, and civil rights organizations to make recommendations for improving the employment verification process. Workers who suffer serious labor violations and cooperate with worker protection agencies will be granted greater access to U visa relief. The bill protects workers who are victims of workplace retaliation from deportation in order to allow labor agencies to interview these workers. It also protects migrant and seasonal workers and increases penalties for employers who violate labor laws. Provisions of interest for agriculture include the following: Adjustment of Status An agricultural worker can adjust to legal permanent resident (LPR) status if they meet eligibility criteria including criminal and national security background checks, pay applicable fees, submit an application, and have performed agricultural labor or services for at least 2,300 work hours (or 400 work days) in the five-year period immediately preceding the date on which such noncitizen file the application. The spouse and children of a noncitizen eligible for adjustment under this section may also adjust to LPR status, provided they meet the eligibility criteria. Spouses and children do not have any agricultural work requirement. Aside from the agriculture worker specific provisions, the Secretary of Homeland Security can grant legal prospective immigrant status to a noncitizen and his or her spouse and children who meet eligibility criteria including criminal and national security background checks and payment of all applicable fees. LPI status will last for 6 years unless and can be renewed. LPI and LPR status holders are eligible for employment authorization. Naturalization Reduces the residence requirement for naturalization from 5 years to 3 years for LPRs who, for at least three years before becoming an LPR, were both lawfully present and eligible for employment authorization. Overtime pay for farmworkers Beginning January 1, 2022, overtime pay shall be required after 55 hours in one week, 50 hours beginning in 2023; 45 hours beginning in 2024; and 40 hours beginning in 2025. The effective date of this section for employers with fewer than 25 employees is delayed by three years, to begin in 2025. Removing Certain Exemptions for Agricultural Work. Amends section 13 of the FLSA, to only allow maximum and minimum hour requirement exceptions to remain for any employee employed in agriculture who is the parent, spouse, or child, or other member of the employers immediate family. Exemptions for agricultural employees that fall under the following criteria are removed: An employee is employed by an employer who did not, during any calendar quarter during the preceding calendar year use more than five hundred man-days of agricultural labor, An employee is employed as a hand harvest laborer and is paid on a piece rate basis in an operation which has been, and is customarily and generally recognized as having been, paid on a piece rate basis in the region of employment, commutes daily from his permanent residence to the farm on which he is so employed, and has been employed in agriculture less than thirteen weeks during the preceding calendar year, An employee is sixteen years of age or under and is employed as a hand harvest laborer, is paid on a piece rate basis in an operation which has been, and is customarily and generally recognized as having been, paid on a piece rate basis in the region of employment, is employed on the same farm as his parent or person standing in the place of his parent, and is paid at the same piece rate as employees over age sixteen are paid on the same farm. An employee is principally engaged in the range production of livestock. Creates a labor law enforcement fund. The fund is intended to be used for compliance activities such as random audits of employers in industries with a history of significant employment of unauthorized workers or H-2As and H- 2Bs. Sets criminal penalties for MSPA violations. Establishes a commission on employment authorization. /// Reviewed President Bidens FY 22 discretionary funding request. The discretionary request proposes $769 billion in non-defense discretionary funding in FY 2022, a 16 percent increase over the FY 2021 enacted level, and $753 billion for national defense programs, a 1.7 percent increase.

Currently ag exporters are experiencing unreasonable detention and demurrage charges, export cargo bookings and other carrier practices, which are essential to allow US agriculture to remain competitive in global markets. The transportation crisis for US agriculture and forest products is becoming increasingly dire each month. There is nothing we produce in agriculture and forest products in this country, that cannot be sourced in some other country. If we cannot deliver, affordably and dependably our products other countries will fill the vacuum. , our foreign customers will find alternatives to our exports. Survey data suggests that on average 22% of US agriculture foreign sales cannot be completed due to ocean carrier rates, declining to carry export cargo, unreasonable demurrage and detention charges, and other practices.

Highlights of HR 267 include: Causes of loss: Maintains the causes of loss that were included for 2018 and 2019 Specifically refers to: smoke taint in wine grapes due to wildfires; high winds; derechos; excessive heat; freeze (including a polar vortex). Expands the drought trigger from D3 on the drought monitor to a Secretarial drought designation (which is D2 for eight consecutive weeks), or more severe, and contiguous counties. Includes losses due to other disruptions (including power outages or curtailments) associated with the effects of a qualifying disaster event. Administrative Improvements: Continues the requirement that participants in this program must purchase crop insurance coverage of at least 60%, or NAP where insurance isnt available, for two years after receiving assistance. Includes language intended to simplify the program, including by directing USDA to streamline the application process and to reduce the workload of county offices. Use of net indemnities - under the existing WHIP+ rules, the payment calculation accounts for the actual value received and any gross crop insurance indemnity. The ANS would account for the producer-paid premium in the calculation. Unharvested acres are treated in the same manner as under NAP. Clarifies that all insured acreage shall be eligible, regardless of whether such acreage is the initial acreage or not. On payment limitations, the ANS maintains the existing regulations, with some exceptions: Specialty crops or higher value crops are subject to the 2017 WHIP payment limitations; Average Adjusted Gross Income is based on the 2017 - 2019 tax years; Limits are renewed for each of 2020 and 2021; and CFAP specialty entity rules apply for operations structured as corporations, LLCs, limited partnerships, trusts, and estates. Includes a mechanism for payments to be made to producers through sugar processors and dairy coops. Continues the authority for USDA to provide payments in the form of block grants. Provides for an authorization of appropriations of $8.5 billion over the 2020 and 2021 timeframe, along with a set aside of funds for administration of the program. Started preparatory work on 2023 farm bill. Identified gaps in existing programs, specifically FSA relief programs and why Oregon growers are having trouble meeting eligibility requirements for extreme weather events. HR 4310, Minks in Narrowly Kept Spaces are Superspreaders Act, which would amend the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 to prohibit the import, export, transport, sale, receipt, acquirement, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce of mink, and for other purposes. The bipartisan infrastructure legislation passed by the Senate and will soon be considered by the House includes several provisions important to the agriculture community. Infrastructure dollars in the Senate package include: $5 billion to help farmers, ranchers and communities respond to drought $870 million per year for the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program, which dedicates funding for rural communities facing budget shortfalls to address essential needs like schools and emergency services; $5 billion for key provisions of the Disaster Safe Power Grid Act to secure the power grid from extreme weather and natural disasters to prevent severe wildfires; $162 million for Klamath habitat restoration work through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service secured by Wyden and Senator Jeff Merkley; $6 billion for wildfire risk mitigation and forest health treatments, including an additional $100 million secured by Wyden for the Collaborative Forestry Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) ensuring that this funding can be used for existing projects. $65 billion to connect every American to high-quality, reliable broadband internet access Reviewed Executive Order addressing unfair markets, the right to repair, poultry tournament pay, Product of the USA labeling and also separately announced $500 million for regional meat packing expansion, as well as $100 million for FSIS Inspection Overtime Relief. The EO directs/encourages : *USDA to consider issuing new rules under the Packers and Stockyards Act making it easier for farmers to bring and win claims and adopting anti-retaliation protections for farmers who speak out about bad practices. *USDA to consider issuing new rules defining when meat can bear Product of USA labels, so that consumers have accurate, transparent labels that enable them to choose products made here. *USDA to develop a plan to increase opportunities for farmers to access markets and receive a fair return, including supporting alternative food distribution systems like farmers markets and developing standards and labels so that consumers can choose to buy products that treat farmers fairly. *FTC to limit powerful equipment manufacturers from restricting peoples ability to use independent repair shops or do DIY repairs-such as when tractor companies block farmers from repairing their own tractors.","Agriculture, Budget/Appropriations, Clean Air and Water (quality), Education, Immigration, Labor Issues/Antitrust/Workplace, Taxation/Internal Revenue Code, Telecommunications, Transportation",,2022-06-06

NACD, like much of congress, opposes the IRS decision on the grounds that it largely weakens the impact of the aid. /// NACD advocated against the reinstatement of the Superfund tax in H.R.3684 - Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act as a pay-for. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed Congress in November and on November 15, the President signed the bipartisan $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) into law. This package included a reinstatement of Superfund Taxes that NACD opposed. The Superfund Tax on chemicals is being sold as a fee on chemicals, but it is really a new tax on consumers. The 42 chemicals identified for taxation are the building blocks for a limitless number of goods, including steel, plastics, wood products, copper, cement, glass, pesticides, fungicides, pharmaceuticals, rubber, paint and coatings, batteries, solar panels, soap and detergents, ceramics, textiles, semiconductors, water treatment, light bulbs, refrigerants, dental fillings, fireworks and consumer electronics. The Superfund Tax on chemicals will also impede the goals of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework by making the components of infrastructure more expensive-including clean energy building blocks such as renewable energy, advanced coatings, energy efficiency solutions and electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure. The Superfund Tax on chemicals will also make U.S. manufacturers less competitive. Additionally, NACD advocated to repeal the excise tax completely or for specific chemicals not manufactured in the US. /// NACD advocated for legislation to be introduced that would require the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) to conduct a review of any systemic decisions by ocean carriers to discriminate against maritime transport of hazmat. Ocean common carriers have continued to refuse service to imports of hazardous material shipments via maritime transport, possibly against the law. The legislation was included in the Senate bill S.3580 that passed the Senate on March 31, 2022.. NACD has advocated in support of H.R.4996 - the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2021 introduced by Reps. John Garamendi (D-CA) and Dusty Johnson (R-SD), and S. 3580 - the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022 - introduced by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and John Thune (R-SD), legislation that would be the first update to federal regulations for the global ocean shipping industry since 1998. This legislation addresses the ongoing supply chain crisis and safeguards US imports and exporters from unfair trade practices. The bill would ensure a more competitive global ocean shipping industry, protect American businesses and consumers from price gouging, and establish reciprocal trade opportunities to reduce the United States longstanding trade imbalance with export-driven countries like China. H.R.4996 passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 364-60 on December 8, 2021. S.3580 passed the Senate unanimously on March 31, 2022. Moving Forward Act - In the House Democratic infrastructure proposal, NACD lobbied for general infrastructure improvements paired with revenue-stabilizing measures in addition to small changes to existing transportation law. NACD advocated for the inclusion of the DRIVE Safe Act language into HR2 as well as changes proposed to the Hazmat title to clarify the status of goods in rail containers. NACD opposes the change to increase the minimum commercial motor vehicle insurance from $750,000 to $2,000,000. Rail Reform - NACD advocated for a full Surface Transportation Board to review and resolve issues related to rail. NACD advocated for rail reform as it relates to competitive switching and demurrage fees. Support of the DRIVE-Safe Act - On March 20, 2021, The Developing Responsible Individuals for a Vibrant Economy Act (H.R. 1745) was introduced in the House by Rep. Trey Hollingsworth (R-IN) and a bipartisan mix of eight original cosponsors (4 republicans and 4 democrats). Sen. Todd Young (R-IN) and a bipartisan mix of seven original cosponsors (3 republicans, 3 democrats, and 1 independent) also introduced the Senate companion bill (S. 659). Currently, 48 states allow individuals to obtain commercial driver licenses at age 18; however, those states prohibit drivers until they are 21 from moving goods across state lines.

The bill directs the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations relating to commercial motor vehicle drivers under the age of 21. /// NACD advocates in opposition to the companion legislation S.420/H.R.842 - Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2021. The PRO Act passed the House in March of this year but has not moved forward in the Senate. Provisions in the PRO Act would force employers to provide their employees' personal information to labor groups without employee consent, infringe upon a worker's right to a secret ballot in union elections, and take away a worker's ability to work independently, especially in those working in the gig economy. NACD advocated against the inclusion of elements of the PRO Act in several pieces of legislation. NACD advocated against allowing the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to issue a vaccine mandate for private employers of 100 employees or more. To minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) released the COVID-19 Vaccination and Testing Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS). This binding ETS requires all businesses with 100 or more employees to adopt, implement, and enforce vaccination, testing, and safety protocols for their workforce. Employers must develop, implement, and enforce a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy or develop, implement, and enforce a policy allowing employees to elect to get vaccinated or to undergo weekly COVID-19 testing and wear a face covering in the workplace. NACD advocated against this act of OSHA and any legislation that would allow OSHA the regulatory authority to do so because 1) OSHA did not offer the public any proper notice or provide sufficient opportunity to comment on this rule before it was finalized. Furthermore, the ETS would significantly expand OSHA's regulatory authority without clear congressional authorization, 2) While the initial ETS applied only to employers with 100 or more employees, OSHA s request for comments suggested that they would look to expand the ETS to smaller businesses in the future, 3) the testing alternative would be unworkable because of the lack of available tests, 4) the mandate would place an undue financial burden on NACD members, and 5) businesses have been significantly impacted by the effects of the pandemic and are working hard to retain their workforce amid ongoing staffing shortages, and this rule would only exacerbate this problem. NACD advocated in support of the Senate voting on December 8, 2021 to overturn the Biden administration's OSHA proposed rule that large private employers must require their workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or tested, or face losing their jobs using the Congressional Review Act. The vote was 52-48, with two Democrats joining all Republicans to overturn the regulation. Legislation that serves, as a solution to the Multiemployer Pension Solvency Crisis, creating a new administration within the Treasury Department to issue loans to plans with (a) critical and declining, (b) critical, or (c) insolvent status. While generally supporting an immediate resolution of the crisis as well as moving the debate to the Senate, NACD is in opposition to bills that do not address underlying structural issues impacting Multi-employer pensions. Legislation that would bring the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) into the 21st century by updating the definition of employee, conforming the definition of employee with other New Deal era statutes that already apply a common-law definition for the term, and reconciling the FLSA with more recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions. Legislation that would (a) force companies to turn over personally identifying information such as addresses, contact information, and shift information on employees to unions, (b) shorten the amount of time businesses would have to prepare for union certifying elections (c) modify the tests for independent-contractor and joint-employer to definitions not consistent with current employment trends, and make many other changes to labor and employment law that would be better debated individually. NACD is in opposition to this bill. /// NACD advocated for the strengthing of cybersecurity for critical infrastructure through a public-private partnership that has liability protections for the private sector. NACD advocated for the inclusion of chemical distribution facilities in the definition of covered critical infrastructure as it relates to drone policy. /// The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), a tariff relief program, expired on December 31, 2020. The GSP, established by the Trade Act of 1974, provides duty relief on products from participating developing countries to promote economic development. NACD supports either a short-term renewal with a clean extension of the program while negotiations continue or a long-term retroactive renewal of GSP. NACD supports S. 1260, the United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2021, that passed the Senate on June 8, 2021, and includes an amendment, the Trade Act of 2021, which would, among other things, allow tariff relief via a multi-year renewal of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program through January 1, 2027. NACD supports H.R. 4037, introduced by Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX), which includes GSP reauthorization and is closely based on the framework of the Senate's Crapo-Wyden bill-turned-amendment, S. 1260. NACD opposes H.R. 3975, introduced by Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), that would extend GSP from its current expiration on Dec. 31, 2020, through Dec. 31, 2024, but it includes sections NACD opposes such as the bill updates the parameters that countries must meet in order to participate in GSP, including labor criteria and environmental standards, among other provisions. Countries participating in GSP would need to prove that they: abide by internationally recognized human rights; enforce environmental laws; combat corruption; and enact economic policies that help lift individuals out of poverty. Additionally, H.R. 3975 would require the president to conduct an annual compliance assessment of GSP beneficiary countries. In addition, the U.S. Trade Representative and deputy undersecretary of Labor for international affairs would be required to conduct an annual assessment of worker benefits in beneficiary countries, including gender-based protections. Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) - The Miscellaneous Tariff Bill, also a tariff relief program, expired on December 31, 2020. The MTB is a trade program facilitated by the U.S. International Trade Commission that provides duty relief on imports that cannot be domestically produced. NACD supported the retroactive renewal of the MTB. NACD supported S. 1260, the United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2021, that passed the Senate on June 8, 2021, and includes an amendment, the Trade Act of 2021, which would, among other things, allow tariff relief via a multi-year renewal of the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) with duty suspensions valid through December 31, 2023. NACD supports H.R. 4037, introduced by Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX), which includes MTB renewal and is closely based on the framework of the Senate's Crapo-Wyden bill-turned-amendment, S. 1260. China Section 301 tariffs - USTR has implemented three China import tariff lists. List 1 and 2 remain in effect, and List 3 has been projected to go from 10% to 25%. NACD supports legislation to remove these import tariffs. NACD has supported S.1260 - United States Innovation and Competition Act that passed the Senate in June and included an amendment that would allow tariff relief via a multi-year renewal of the GSP program through January 1, 2027, and an MTB with duty suspensions valid through December 31, 2023. NACD is advocating for the House of Representatives to take up the Senate legislation. /// General support for H.R.3684 - Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Specifically, support of additional funding for ports and the inclusion of the DRIVE Safe Act or a similar pilot program in the bill package. In opposition to this legislation surrounding the reinstatement of the Superfund excise tax. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed Congress in November and on November 15, the President signed the bipartisan $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) into law.

H.R. 7 This bill addresses wage discrimination on the basis of sex, which is defined to include pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics. Specifically, it limits an employer's defense that a pay differential is based on a factor other than sex to only bona fide job-related factors in wage discrimination claims, enhances nonretaliation prohibitions, and makes it unlawful to require an employee to sign a contract or waiver prohibiting the employee from disclosing information about the employee's wages. The bill also increases civil penalties for violations of equal pay provisions. Additionally, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs must train EEOC employees and other affected parties on wage discrimination. The bill directs the Department of Labor to (1) establish and carry out a grant program to provide training in negotiation skills related to compensation and equitable working conditions, (2) conduct studies to eliminate pay disparities between men and women, and (3) make available information on wage discrimination to assist the public in understanding and addressing such discrimination. The bill establishes the National Award for Pay Equity in the Workplace for an employer who has made a substantial effort to eliminate pay disparities between men and women. It also establishes the National Equal Pay Enforcement Task Force to address compliance, public education, and enforcement of equal pay laws. Finally, the bill requires the EEOC to issue regulations for collecting from employers compensation and other employment data according to the sex, race, and national origin of employees for use in enforcing laws prohibiting pay discrimination. /// Paid Parental Leave Act [H.R.1534] to provide four weeks of paid leave to federal workers upon the birth or adoption of a child.
